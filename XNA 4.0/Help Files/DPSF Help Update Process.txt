When updating "DPSF Help.chm", make the updates in the "DPSF Help Without API Documentation.hmxz" project. This is done to avoid importing the "DPSF API Documentation" into the project more than once, as this is likely to produce dead links to topics.
Once you are finished editing and want to create a new .chm for release: 

0. Save the changes made, overwriting the existing "DPSF Help Without API Documentation.hmxz".

1. Do a "Save As" and overwrite the "DPSF Help.hmxz" project, if it exists.

2. Import the "DPSF API Documentation.chm" (making sure you have updated/rebuilt it first). You will want to make sure there is NO checkmark in "Try to split HTML topics into (separate) header and body", and the "Which part goes into the topic body?" is set to "Everything that does not go into the topic header". These settings don't produce the ideal look, but they provide the best look from the options given to work with.

3. Once the "DPSF API Documentation.chm" has been imported, Save the project (if you save after doing the next few steps the save will take a very long time).

4. Click on the new DPSF API Documentation section and then click the "Topic Options" tab on the bottom. Change its Title Tag to be "DPSF API Documentation" if needed, and its Topic ID to be "DPSF_API_Documentation". This has to be done so that the links in the rest of the help documentation will work.

Pre 5. Make sure you have unchecked Show Warnings in the "Program Options" Compilers tab, as there will be lots and if you display them it takes an extra 10 minutes or so.

5. Save the "DPSF Help.hmxz" project then publish (export) it to a HTML Help (.chm) file and a WebHelp file (HTML files). You should delete the existing "HTML" folder (if it exists) before exporting it to a WebHelp file to delete any files that are not in the updated version.  Each export will take around 5 minutes; 15 minutes if you forgot to uncheck the Show Warnings box in the previous step.
