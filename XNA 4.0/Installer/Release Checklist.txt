When releasing a new version of DPSF, be sure to follow these steps:

Steps 1 - 15 are now handled by the BuildNewDpsfRelease.ps1 script.

18 - Open the "DPSF Installer Settings.iit" and Build a new "DPSF Installer.exe", making sure to include any new links that should appear in the Start Menu DPSF folder, such as links to new tutorials, demos, etc. and update the DPSF EULA if it was updated in the help documentation.

19 - Install DPSF from the new installer and make sure the DPSF Demo works properly. Then uninstall it and make sure everything is removed properly.

20 - Create a copy of the installer and move it into the "Archived Installers" section, renaming it with it's version number, and then zip it up to be uploaded to the web.

21 - now handled by the BuildNewDpsfRelease.ps1 script.

22 - Check files into Git, adding the current dll version (e.g. v1.0.1.1) and Change Log to the SVN commit comments.

23 - Upload the new version to the web, along with the new HTML help files, and update the RSS feed to show a new version. The web has it's own "Release Process.txt" file to follow.
