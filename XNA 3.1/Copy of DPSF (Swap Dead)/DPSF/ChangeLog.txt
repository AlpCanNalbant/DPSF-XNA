=====================================================================
This document should show all of the technical changes to DPSF (private), 
as well as the larger changes that the users should be aware of (public)
=====================================================================

Changes made after Version 1.3.0.0:
public:
	- Removed DPSF.ActiveParticles and DPSF.InactiveParticles properties.
	- DPSF.NumberOfActiveParticles property is now updated before the Particle Initialization Function is called.
	
private:


Changes made after Version 1.2.0.0:
public:
- Fixed bug in DPSFHelper.RandomNormalizedVector() function where it only returned positive vectors.
- Renamed Emitter.EmitParticles property to Emitter.EmitParticlesAutomatically.
- Added Emitter.Enabled property.
- Added Emitter.BurstParticles and Emitter.BurstTime properties to release particles in bursts.
- Renamed UpdateParticleSystemTurnEmitterOn/Off() functions to UpdateParticleSystemEmitParticlesAutomaticallyOn/Off().
- Added UpdateParticleSystemEnableEmitter() and UpdateParticleSystemDisableEmitter() particle system update functions to the Default classes.
- Fixed bug where an "index out of range" exception would be thrown when removing Events from within an Event function.
- Renamed MultipleChangeParticleSystem.cs to SquarePatternParticleSystem.cs and changed some of its functions.
- Formatted a lot of the XML documentation better.
- Fixed bug in DPSFDefaultEffect.fx which caused Point Sprites to be displayed smaller when their rotation was zero.
- Created first 5 tutorials in the Help Documentation.


Changes made after Version 1.1.1.0:
public:
- Changed what happens a little bit when a particle is in the exact same position as a magnet affecting it,
	so now the particle is only pushed in a random direction if the magnet is repelling it (not attracting it).
- Renamed the DefaultParticleSystemMagnet.DistanceFunctions enumeration's value "SameForceAtAllDistances" to "Constant".
- Added Grid particle system to Demo.
- Added Sphere particle system to Demo.
- Fixed bug where exception would be thrown when reducing the NumberOfParticlesAllocatedInMemory to less than
	what was currently in the particle system already.
- Added global variable miPARTICLE_SYSTEM_UPDATES_PER_SECOND to GameMain.cs to control how often the particle systems
	are updated.
- Fixed bug in the ParticleSystemManager.AutoInitializeAllParticleSystems() function where not all Particle Systems
	were being initialized.
- Added DPSFHelper.RandomNumberBetween(min, max) function for returning random numbers in a given range.
- Changed the Default Point Sprite and Quad Particle System classes and Templates to reset the RenderState's 
	AlphaBlendEnable and AlphaTestEnable properties to false after Draw() is called.
- Added SimulationSpeed and UpdatesPerSecond properties to the individual particle systems, and changing the Particle
	System Manager's SimulationSpeed / UpdatesPerSecond now sets the individual particle systems' properties.
- Changed the SimulationSpeed and UpdatesPerSecond properties to work the same when inheriting from
	DrawableGameComponent or not.
- Added ParticleSystemManagerToCopyPropertiesFrom property to the particle systems (Copies SimulationSpeed and UpdatesPerSecond).
- Added a NoDisplay Particle Type that can offer better performance for particle systems that do not need to be
	visualized (i.e. drawn to the screen), such as for some research applications.
- Added a RandomNumbers class that inherits the Random class and adds more functionality.
- Replaced the PointOnVertical/HorizontalCircle() functions in DPSFHelper with more generic PointOnSphere() functions.

private:
- Added new event functions to the Particle System Manager so when a Particle System's Update or Draw Order is changed,
	the Particle System Lists are not resorted right away, they are resorted before performing the next Update / Draw.
- Changed the InitializeCommonVariables() function so the Update and Draw Orders are not reset to zero.
- Made the VertexElement property private.


Changes made after Version 1.1.0.0:
public:
- Fixed bug where a particle would be given an invalid position when it was in the exact same position 
	as a magnet affecting it.
- Added global boolean values to GameMain.cs to turn building an Animated GIF and TileSetImage on/off
	when building images from an animation.
- Added a null check to the DPSF.GraphicsDevice property
